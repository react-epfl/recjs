# repository must be the URL of the repository you want this recipe to
# correspond to. The deploy_to path must be the path on each machine that will
# form the root of the application path.

# =============================================================================
# TASKS
# =============================================================================
# Define tasks that run on all (or only some) of the machines. You can specify
# a role (or set of roles) that each task should be executed on. You can also
# narrow the set of servers to a subset of a role by specifying options, which
# must match the options given for the servers to select (like :primary => true)

desc <<DESC
An imaginary backup task. (Execute the 'show_tasks' task to display all
available tasks.)
DESC
task :backup, :roles => :db, :only => { :primary => true } do
  # the on_rollback handler is only executed if this task is executed within
  # a transaction (see below), AND it or a subsequent task fails.
  on_rollback { delete "/tmp/dump.sql" }

  run "mysqldump -u theuser -p thedatabase > /tmp/dump.sql" do |ch, stream, out|
    ch.send_data "thepassword\n" if out =~ /^Enter password:/
  end
end

# Tasks may take advantage of several different helper methods to interact
# with the remote server(s). These are:
#
# * run(command, options={}, &block): execute the given command on all servers
#   associated with the current task, in parallel. The block, if given, should
#   accept three parameters: the communication channel, a symbol identifying the
#   type of stream (:err or :out), and the data. The block is invoked for all
#   output from the command, allowing you to inspect output and act
#   accordingly.
# * sudo(command, options={}, &block): same as run, but it executes the command
#   via sudo.
# * delete(path, options={}): deletes the given file or directory from all
#   associated servers. If :recursive => true is given in the options, the
#   delete uses "rm -rf" instead of "rm -f".
# * put(buffer, path, options={}): creates or overwrites a file at "path" on
#   all associated servers, populating it with the contents of "buffer". You
#   can specify :mode as an integer value, which will be used to set the mode
#   on the file.
# * render(template, options={}) or render(options={}): renders the given
#   template and returns a string. Alternatively, if the :template key is given,
#   it will be treated as the contents of the template to render. Any other keys
#   are treated as local variables, which are made available to the (ERb)
#   template.

desc "Demonstrates the various helper methods available to recipes."
task :helper_demo do
  # "setup" is a standard task which sets up the directory structure on the
  # remote servers. It is a good idea to run the "setup" task at least once
  # at the beginning of your app's lifetime (it is non-destructive).
